# Project 4

Project 4 explored exact and approximate inference with and without Time Elapse. Each method is implemented in 3 parts: observation, with Time Elapse, and then a full test with the completed implementation. It also touches on a Joint Particle Filter in the later parts of the project. Individual functions were written for each part of the project and used the provide AI structure to simulate the results.
