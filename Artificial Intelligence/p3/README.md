# Project 3

Project 3 focused on different types of AI reinforcement policies like value iteration and Q-learning. Examples of each of the policies represented graphically are labeled and included below. The squares represent possible moves on a game board and each policy weights choices differently. When these are applied to the PacMan avatar, its behavior changes according to what its current policy deems the best choice.
