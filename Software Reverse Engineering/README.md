# Software Reverse Engineering

For this course, we used the NSAs disassembler and decompiler Ghidra and learned how to change binaries back into human readable code, how to reverse engineer and analyze malware, and how to find and exploit vulnerabilities in software. Although difficult, I found this subject extremely interesting. I gained a much deeper understanding of how computers process executables, what binary files actually contain, and how to manipulate the tools we were provided to solve relatively complex problems hiding inside executable files. This class was a lot of fun and I really think I took a lot of good information away from it, even if it doesn't really pertain all that much to software engineering.

### [Assignment 5](./Assignment_5/)

Given CrackMe's to solve. `randomKey.cpp` and `randomKey.py` are both variations of the same key-cracking program. `task1lib.c` is a hook function used to change the behavior of a binary's function with the same name. `task2.c` is a CrackMe decompiled into C from machine code. `randomKey.cpp` and `randomKey.py` are used to crack this.

### [Assignment 6](./Assignment_6/)

Tasked with created our own CrackMe's. All files are variations of `crackme_joearbo13.c` with different compiler options. `keyGen.py` is used to find a valid key to the custom CrackMe.
