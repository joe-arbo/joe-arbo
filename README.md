# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joseph Arbolino

### Thanks for stopping in!

This is a collection of all the projects and exercises I completed or collaborated on. I have tried to make this GitHub as user-friendly as possible and have included as many explanations, pictures, examples, and directions for execution as I could. Most of these projects were completed during my college career and therefore include many files needed for the execution of the programs but that I didn't write myself. These files were all interfaced with during the completion of the projects so I do understand how all the code works and what its purpose is, but it would be wrong of me to pass these on as my own work. 

This is also the reason GitHub reports the language variance to be ~70% Python. Most of the supporting files provided for us were written in Python so the actual split between the languages I actively practice and code in is more even. Below is a table of contents (of a sort) giving an overview of what each folder in this repository contains. There will be more information provided in each folder, if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me with the details found in the [Contact Information](#contact-information) section.

If you are seeing this on my Profile page, you can navigate to the main repository by clicking [HERE](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo), or you can navigate to the individual folders described below by clicking on their header.

## [Arduino](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Arduino)

Includes two personal projects and all projects from my Advanced Real-Time Systems class. RTS was an interesting class based on the FreeRTOS real-time operating system. Most of the class focused on the scheduling of tasks in an OS and the different methods to do so. For example, RM and DM scheduling are accurately modeled in one of the projects, and tasks are simulated using an Arduino file. FreeRTOS has a library usable in Arduino and gives greater system-level control over applications running on Arduino compatible microcontrollers (in our case an Arduino Mega). 

As for the personal projects, my favorite is included in this section. It was inspired by the COVID closures and my Dad's drinking buddies now deciding their new "watering hole" would be my driveway. It's not the most complex project, but it was the most fun I had designing something and it allowed me to step outside my comfort zone. Take a shortcut to it [HERE](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Arduino/Can_Crusher).

The other personal project was a simple bluetooth based Android application using Arduino that I worked on with a friend. The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with breadboard wiring, bluetooth modules, and Android applications. None of this was intended for deployable use. You can see some examples of this project below.

### [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Artificial%20Intelligence)

This class was adapted from a course at UC Berkeley and used by the Virginia Tech CS department. As a result, most projects are accredited to individuals belonging to UC Berkeley. The class explores common AI principles from simple search algorithms, to Q-learning, to Inference Observation. I completed 5 main projects here that use a Pac-Man-like game interface to demonstrate these core concepts. 

Each project is housed inside its own folder and has an index.html file explaining how to run the tests and what was required for each project. There is also a README in each project folder explaining briefly what the project entailed and what concepts it taught, as well as pictures of what each program's GUI looks like at run-time to demonstrate their functionality.  

Here are some run-time GUI examples (Iteration and Inference respectively):

### [Computer Systems](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Computer%20Systems)

This was one of the more difficult classes I took while getting my degree. Its purpose was to explore and demonstrate how an OS works under the hood using primarily C. The projects were difficult and taught concepts like process management, memory allocation, secure servers, and multithreaded workloads.

This section contains 4 major projects and some exercises completed in this class. All projects were completed with a partner who has been notified of their works' representation here. These projects are hard to demonstrate graphically so a README is included in each folder to explain either how to use the program or what the program does. Hopefully, this will make it easy to understand the concepts and C foundations I learned in this class.

This class provides many support files for the completion of its projects so not every file was developed by me or my partner. I have tried to properly document files that may have other contributors but it is difficult to point out which parts in every file were edited by my partner and me. Because of this, I will state a disclaimer that even though most files were, at the very least, modified by my partner and me, I cannot guarantee that all work viewed belongs to us. All files are necessary for the execution of these programs so removing any of them is not an option, but if any questions arise as to the specifics of any files, please do not hesitate to reach out.

### [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms)

The name of this course speaks for itself. It explores common data structures and sorting algorithms and how to utilize them in programming applications. This class covered external sorting using a Min-Heap and Merge Sort, key-value pair sorting using hash maps, and key-value pair sorting using a skip list and Quad-Tree. This class was partner based and all files were worked on by both my partner and me. The author of each file is listed in the JavaDocs of said file and only indicates the creator, it does not reflect work done.

This class was done entirely in Java, however, I did take another DSA course that was done in C++. That class explored similar topics such as linked lists, binary search algorithms/trees, Ray-Tracing, Deques, mini-max, and more. The projects completed for that class were much more in-depth than the Java class and I wish I could display them here. Unfortunately, the SSD those projects were stored on was corrupted before I had a chance to back them up. Because of this, the only projects located here are in Java. 

These projects are hard to show graphically and even harder to run while showing any intelligible information. They were also graded automatically so instead of directions for execution, I briefly describe what each project implements and which files are important.

### [Embedded Systems](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Embedded%20Systems)

The primary focus of my Embedded Systems course was to learn how to interface with the MSP432P401R LaunchPad microcontroller and its BoosterPack hardware module. There are 3 projects for this class, each building on the last. The first project focuses on learning how the MSP and BoosterPack communicate with one another, project two focuses on the GUI elements and the interaction between the microcontroller and UART keyboard inputs, and the third project focused on making a fully functional game using the BoosterPacks controls. 

This class was programmed in C and uses the MSPs ports (similar to Arduino) to write information to the BoosterPack. This made designing and programming a relatively simple game more challenging because it was no longer as simple as telling the screen what to display. These projects can't be simulated without the MSP so explanations and pictures of the BoosterPack display are included in each project folder. An example of the MSPs display can be seen below.
