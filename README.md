# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joseph Arbolino

### Thanks for stopping in!

This is a collection of all the projects and exercises I completed or collaborated on. I have tried to make this GitHub as user-friendly as possible and have included as many explanations, pictures, examples, and directions for execution as I could. Most of these projects were completed during my college career and therefore include many files needed for the execution of the program but I didn't write myself. These files were all interfaced with during the completion of the projects so I do understand how all the code works and what its purpose is, but it would be wrong of me to pass these on as my own work. 

This is also the reason GitHub reports the language variance to be ~70% Python. Most of the supporting files provided for us were written in Python so the actual split between the languages I actively practice and code in is more even. Below is a table of contents (of a sort) giving a brief overview of what each folder in this repository contains. There will be more information provided in each folder, if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me with the details found in the [Contact Information](#contact-information) section.

If you a seeing this on my Profile page, you can navigate the main repository page click [HERE](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo), otherwise you can navigate to the individual folders described below by clicking on their header.

### [Arduino](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Arduino)

Includes two personal projects and all projects from my Advanced Real-Time Systems class. RTS was an interesting class based on the FreeRTOS real-time operating system. Most of the class focused on the scheduling of tasks in an OS and the different methods to do so. For example, RM and DM scheduling are accurately modeled in one of the projects, and tasks are simulated using an Arduino file. FreeRTOS has a library usable in Arduino and can be used to have greater system-level control over applications running on Arduino compatible microcontrollers (in our case an Arduino Mega). 

As for the personal projects, my favorite is included in this section. It was inspired by the COVID closures and my Dad's drinking buddies now deciding their new "watering hole" would be my driveway. It's not the most complex project, but it was the most fun I had designing something and it allowed me to step outside my comfort zone. Take a shortcut to it [HERE](https://github.com/joe-arbo/joe-arbo/tree/main/Arduino/Can_Crusher).
