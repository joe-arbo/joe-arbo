# Data Structures and Algorithms

This course explored common data structures and sorting algorithms and how to utilize them in programming applications. It covered external sorting using a Min-Heap and Merge Sort, key-value pair sorting using hash maps, and key-value pair sorting using a skip list and Quad-Tree. This class was partner based and all files were worked on by both my partner and me. The author of each file is listed in the JavaDocs of said file and only indicates the creator, it does not reflect work done.

Instead of including a README in each sub-folder, I've opted to describe each project here. These projects really speak for themselves and only served to teach us about the data structures and sorting algorithms utilized by each program. As a result, there isn't much functionality to describe since each project only takes in information to parse and then sorts and stores that data. The programs only output is formatted text used for automatic grading.
