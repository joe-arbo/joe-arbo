# Embedded Systems

The primary focus of my Embedded Systems course was to learn how to interface with the MSP432P401R LaunchPad microcontroller and its BoosterPack hardware module. There are 3 projects for this class, each building on the last. This class was programmed in C and uses the MSPs ports (similar to Arduino) to write information to the BoosterPack. This made designing and programming a relatively simple game more challenging because it was no longer as simple as telling the screen what to display. These projects can't be simulated without the MSP so explanations and pictures of the BoosterPack display are included in each project folder.

A brief description of each project is included below and more information, as well as pictures of anything relevant, are included inside each individual project folder.
